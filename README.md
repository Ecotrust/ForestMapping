# ForestMapping

Methodology for processing original lidar and imagery data to 
generate identified forest indicators. These indicators will 
be used to inform forest type maps included in assessment templates 
prepared for participating landowners. 

The methods and code for this work are focused on a random subset
within the Portland Metro project area and are meant as demonstration
of methodology.
